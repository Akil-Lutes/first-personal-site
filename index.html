            <p>Ciara, Merry Christmas my gaming sister. I hope you keep being the genius that you are and do good in school. I am happy that I got to hang out with you because your genius rubbed off on me. I have some of your genius now lol.</p>

            <p>Dr. Z, I can never thank you enough. You welcomed me into your home without even knowing me. You made me your family. I felt loved by you, even now. You will always be family to me. I wrote you a letter, but I never got around to sending it because of the virus. Then I thought making a web page would be more meaningful to you. If you ever need anything, I'll jump on the first flight for you. Until we meet again!</p>
